## Branching Strategy

Our repository uses a **Git branching model** with two main branches:

- **develop:** The default branch for ongoing development and feature integration. **Please create your feature or bugfix branch from `develop` and submit your pull requests against `develop`.**
- **main:** The stable branch containing production-ready code. Only tested and reviewed changes from `develop` are merged into `main`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Explain the purpose of your changes.
- Reference any issues your PR addresses.
- Keep changes focused on one problem at a time.
- Ensure all new and existing tests pass.

Your contributions are greatly appreciated. Thank you for helping improve **Home Items**!
